Among the rules embodied in the Health Code is Article 81 which regulates the operations of food establishments for the purpose of preventing public health hazards. Environmental Health Division  The Division of Environmental Health is the Commission within the Health Department that is concerned with public health and works to eliminate the incidence of injury and illness caused by environmental factors. There are several Offices and Bureaus within this division. One of these is the Bureau of Food Safety and Community Sanitation that has the responsibility for conducting inspections of food service and food processing establishments. These inspections are performed by Public Health Sanitarians. Anti-corruption Warning All Sanitarians have Department of Health and Mental Hygiene badges and identification cards which they must display whenever it is requested of them. It is illegal to offer a Sanitarian any bribe, gratuity or reward for official misconduct; this is a crime that can result in fines, and /or imprisonment, and the revocation of permits. Also, Sanitarians are not authorized to conduct any monetary transactions on behalf of the Department. Inspector General This is an office that exists within the Health Department with the responsibility of investigating any incidence of alleged corrupt activity. Investigations may be conducted as a result of complaints by employees of the Department or members of the public. Health Academy The Health Academy is an office within the Division of Environmental Health. One of its responsibilities is to provide training and certification courses for individuals from the public as mandated by the Health Code. The Food Protection Course is one of the courses taught here. The Food Protection Course is required by the Health Code for supervisors of food service establishments and non-retail food processing establishments. These individuals must take the course and pass an examination before a certificate is issued to them. A person holding such a certificate must be on the premises and supervise all food preparation activities during all hours of operation. Several supervisors with this certification may be needed at an establishment to have coverage during all shifts, vacations or illnesses. The Food Protection Manual has been designed to assist participants of the course to better understand the principles of safe food handling. It serves as a reference for food service operators and it includes the necessary information to pass the final examination. On-Line Food Protection Course The Food Protection Course in English, Spanish and Chinese is now also available on-line. This course is designed for individuals with busy schedules to study at their convenience. After the completion of the course, a final examination is scheduled at the Health Academy.\n",

            "The United States has one of the safest food safety systems in the world, yet millions of Americans still get sick each year from eating contaminated foods; hundreds of thousands are hospitalized; and several thousand die. This means that there is still tremendous room for improvement in food safety standards. Most food-borne illnesses are caused by improper handling of food. The statistics from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) show that some of the most common causes of foodborne illness are:  Sick food worker  Poor personal Hygiene/Bare hand contact  Improper holding temperatures  Improper cooling  Inadequate cooking and reheating  Cross contamination  Use of food from unknown source What is Food-Borne Illness? Any illness that is caused by food is called food-borne illness. A foodborne illness outbreak is defined as any incident involving two or more persons becoming ill with similar symptoms from the same source. Typically these illnesses are a direct result of contamination of food by harmful microorganisms, (commonly called germs) such as bacteria, viruses, parasites, fungi etc. Injury and illness caused by foreign objects, dangerous chemicals and/or allergens in food is also considered a foodborne illness. Who is at Risk? We are all at risk of getting a food borne illness; however, the effects are more severe for certain categories of individuals:  Children whose immune system (human body’s defense system against diseases) is not fully developed yet. Elderly individuals because their immune system is not robust anymore and has weakened due to old age. Pregnant women where the threat is both to the mother and the fetus. Individuals with compromised immune systems e.g., Patients with AIDS, cancer  or individuals who are diabetics, etc. People on medication (antibiotics, immunosuppressant, etc.). What is food?\n",

This expression refers to those foods that provide suitable conditions for rapid growth of microorganisms. These include foods that are high in protein like raw or cooked animal products such as meats, poultry, fish, shellfish (mollusks as well as crustaceans), milk and milk products (cheese, butter milk, heavy cream etc.,), plant protein such as tofu, and starches such as cooked rice, cooked pasta, cooked beans and cooked vegetables like potatoes, cut melons, cut leafy greens, cut tomatoes or mixtures of cut tomatoes, as well as raw seed sprouts and garlic in oil. Exceptions: Those foods that have a low water activity (.85 or less) or those that are highly acidic with a pH of 4.6 or below.

            " Store foods away from dripping condensate , at least six inches above the floor and with enough space between items to encourage air circulation. Freezer Storage Freezing is an excellent method for prolonging the shelf life of foods. By keeping foods frozen solid, the bacterial growth is minimal at best. However, if frozen foods are thawed and then refrozen, then harmful bacteria can reproduce to dangerous levels when thawed for the second time. In addition to that, the quality of the food is also affected. Never refreeze thawed foods, instead use them immediately. Keep the following rules in mind for freezer storage:  Use First In First Out method of stock rotation. All frozen foods should be frozen solid with temperature at 0°F or lower. Always use clean containers that are clearly labeled and marked, and have proper and secure lids. Allow adequate spacing between food containers to allow for proper air circulation. Never use the freezer for cooling hot foods. * * Tip: When receiving multiple items, always store the frozen foods first, then foods that are to be refrigerated, and finally the non perishable dry goods. Dry Storage Proper storage of dry foods such as cereals, flour, rice, starches, spices, canned goods, packaged foods and vegetables that do not require refrigeration ensures that these foods will still be usable when needed. Adequate storage space as well as low humidity (50% or less), and low temperatures (70 °F or less) are strongly recommended.\n",
            "Only use food containers that are clean, non-absorbent and are made from food-grade material intended for such use. Containers made from metal may react with certain type of high acid foods such as sauerkraut, citrus juices, tomato sauce, etc. Plastic food-grade containers are the best choice for these types of foods. Containers made of copper, brass, tin and galvanized metal should not be used. The use of such products is prohibited. Re-using cardboard containers to store cooked foods is also a source of contamination. Lining containers with newspapers, menus or other publication before placing foods is also prohibited as chemical dyes from these can easily leach into foods. Storage Areas Foods should only be stored in designated areas. Storing foods in passageways, rest rooms, garbage areas, utility rooms, etc. would subject these to contamination. Raw foods must always be stored below and away from cooked foods to avoid cross contamination. Refrigerated Storage This type of storage is typically used for holding potentially hazardous foods as well as perishable foods for short periods of time—a few hours to a few days. An adequate number of efficient refrigerated units are required to store potentially hazardous cold foods. By keeping cold foods cold, the microorganisms that are found naturally on these foods are kept to a minimum. Cold temperature does not kill microorganisms, however, it slows down their growth. Pre-packaged cold foods must be stored at temperatures recommended by the manufacturer. This is especially important when dealing with vacuum packed foods, modified atmosphere packages and sous vide foods. Smoked fish is required by the Health Code to be stored at 38°F or below. Fresh meat, poultry and other potentially hazardous foods must be stored at 41°F or below, while frozen foods must be stored at 0°F or below. For foods to be maintained at these temperatures, refrigerators and freezers must be operating at temperatures lower than 41°F and 0°F., respectively. Thermometers placed in the warmest part of a refrigerated unit are necessary to monitor the temperature of each unit. The rule of storage, First In First Out (FIFO) ensures that older deliveries are used up before newer ones. In practicing FIFO, the very first step would be to date all products as they are received. The next step is to store the newer products behind the older ones. The following rules are important in making sure that foods are safe during refrigerated storage:  Store cooked foods above raw foods to avoid cross-contamination. Keep cooked food items covered unless they are in the process of cooling, in which case they must be covered after being cooled to 41°F. Avoid placing large pots of hot foods in a refrigerator.\n",
            "l Store food in vermin-proof containers — metal or glass  containers, with tightly fitted lids. l Remove dented, leaking, rusted, swollen or unlabeled canned goods. Cold Storage: l All PHFs must be stored at 41° F (Except smoked fish at 38° F and raw shell eggs at 45 ° F). l All cooked and ready-to-eat food must be stored away from and above raw food. l Do not store foods in quantities that exceed the storage unit’s  capacity. l Place a refrigeration thermometer in the warmest spot in the unit to measure ambient air temperature of the unit l Check for condensation that may contaminate food. l Keep frozen foods frozen at 0° F or lower. STORAGE\n",
            "Furthermore, it is improper to store food in ice machines or ice that will be later used for human consumption. Food should be stored at least six inches off the floor, away from walls and dripping pipes. Keep all food, bulk or otherwise, covered and safe from contamination. Check food daily and throw away any spoiled or contaminated food. Store cleaning, disinfecting, and other chemicals away from foods, clearly marked and in their original containers. Keep food refrigerated at a temperature of 41°F or below. Monitor temperatures regularly with a thermometer placed in the warmest part of the refrigerator. Keep all cooling compartments closed except when you are using them. Store food in a refrigerator in such a way that the air inside can circulate freely. Keep all refrigerated foods covered, and use up stored leftovers quickly. When dishes and utensils are sparkling clean, keep them that way by proper storage.\n",
            "In addition to the above, avoid sunlight as it may affect the quality of some foods. Following are some of the guidelines:  Use First In First Out method of stock rotation. Keep foods at least 6 inches off the floor. This allows for proper cleaning and to detect vermin activity. Keep foods in containers with tightly fitted lids. Keep dry storage areas well lighted and ventilated. Install shades on windows to prevent exposure from sunlight. Do not store foods under overhead water lines that may drip due to leaks or condensation. Do not store garbage in dry food storage areas. Make sure that dry storage area is vermin proof by sealing walls and baseboards and by repairing holes and other openings. * * Safety Tip: Storage of harmful chemicals in the food storage areas can create hazardous situations and hence is prohibited by law. All chemicals must be labeled properly and used in accordance to the instructions on the label. Pesticide use is prohibited unless used by a licensed pest control officer. Storage in Ice Whenever food items are to be stored in ice, care must be taken to ensure that water from the melted ice is constantly being drained so that the food remains on ice and not immersed in iced water.\n"
